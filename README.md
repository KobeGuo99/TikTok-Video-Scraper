A web scraping program made in Python to scan through a users' TikTok profile and download all the videos with no watermark

Steps to use:
1. Download all the modules used (selenium, BeautifulSoup)
2. Run this program using an IDE (VSCode) or terminal
3. Enter the url of the TikTok account (Ex: https://www.tiktok.com/@gordonramsayofficial)
4. All of the users' videos will be downloaded into the videos folder
5. Each video will take 10 seconds each to download (so beware accounts with very large amounts of videos)
6. To use again, delete all videos in the videos folder and rerun the program with a different url
